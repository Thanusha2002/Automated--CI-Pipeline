AUTOMATED CI PIPELINE FOR WEB APLLICATION USIN JENKINS                                             
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and implement a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline using Jenkins for a modern web application.
The pipeline automatically triggers whenever new code is pushed to a GitHub repository. It performs automated steps including code retrieval, dependency installation, testing, building, and artifact packaging — ensuring the application is always ready for deployment.
The project focuses on automation, reliability, and repeatability, which are key principles of modern DevOps practices.

Objectives

.Learn how to install and configure Jenkins for CI pipelines.

.Automate the build and test process of a web application.

.Integrate GitHub with Jenkins for automatic build triggers.

.Generate and archive build artifacts for future deployment.

.Understand Jenkins pipeline concepts and job configuration.

Tech Stack

.Language/Framework: Node.js (can also use Python Flask or Java Spring Boot)

.CI Tool: Jenkins

.Version Control: GitHub

.Testing Framework: Jest (Node.js) / Pytest (Python) / JUnit (Java)

.Build Tool: npm / Maven / Gradle

Pipeline Overview
Stage	Description
1. Code Checkout	Jenkins pulls the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2. Dependency Installation	Installs project dependencies using npm, pip, or Maven.
3. Static Code Analysis (Optional)	Checks code quality using ESLint, Flake8, or Checkstyle.
4. Unit Testing	Runs automated tests to verify code functionality.
5. Build and Package	Packages the application into a deployable format (e.g., .zip, .jar, .tar.gz).
6. Post-Build Actions	Archives artifacts and displays build and test reports.

Setup Instructions

 Install Jenkins

1.Download and install Jenkins from https://www.jenkins.io/download/

Start Jenkins and install the recommended plugins.

2. Connect GitHub Repository

Create a GitHub repository for your web application.

Configure a webhook to trigger Jenkins on new commits or pull requests.

Add your repository credentials in Jenkins if it is private.

3. Create and Configure Pipeline

Open Jenkins and create a new Pipeline job.

Choose Pipeline script from SCM and select Git.

Enter your GitHub repository URL and branch (e.g., main).

Save the configuration and click Build Now to start the pipeline.

4. View Pipeline Execution

Jenkins will execute each stage defined in the Jenkinsfile.

You can monitor progress and results in the Pipeline Stage View.

#Expected Outputs

Build Artifact: A packaged output file (e.g., artifact.zip, .jar, or .tar.gz) stored in the build/ directory.

Test Report: Generated automatically and viewable in Jenkins.

Archived Artifacts: Stored in Jenkins for later use or deployment.
